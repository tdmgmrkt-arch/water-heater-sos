    question: "Do you offer both dryer vent cleaning and air duct cleaning?",
    answer: "Yes, for years now we have been offering both services under our former name Vent Gator. With years of experience, our skilled technicians provide reliable, professional service tailored to your needs. We prioritize customer satisfaction, offering transparent pricing and no hidden fees. Whether you're in Yucaipa or Riverside, we're your local experts dedicated to keeping your home safe and efficient.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I have my dryer vent cleaned?",
    answer: "We recommend having your dryer vent cleaned at least once a year. However, if you do a lot of laundry, have a large family, or notice that your dryer is taking longer to dry clothes, you may need more frequent cleanings. Regular cleaning prevents lint buildup, reduces fire risk, and improves dryer efficiency.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the signs that my air ducts need cleaning?",
    answer: "Common signs include visible dust buildup around vents, musty odors when your HVAC system runs, increased allergy symptoms, inconsistent airflow between rooms, and higher energy bills. If you've recently moved into a new home or completed renovations, it's also a good time to have your air ducts professionally cleaned.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will air duct cleaning help with my allergies?",
    answer: "Yes, professional air duct cleaning can significantly improve indoor air quality by removing dust, pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and other allergens that accumulate in your HVAC system. This can help reduce allergy symptoms and create a healthier living environment for you and your family.",
